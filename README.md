# python-aero-downforce.vs.drag
This project used Python to model how aerodynamic forces vary with speed and angle of attack (AoA). By implementing thin-airfoil theory and a parabolic drag polar, I generated downforce–speed curves and drag polars that illustrate aerodynamic efficiency trade-offs relevant to Formula One front wing design.
